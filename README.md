# Laser Bender

A simple Android application that simulates laser beams, mirrors, and flags.

## Features

*   Add and move light sources, mirrors, and flags.
*   Rotate objects to direct the laser beam.
*   Change the color of the light sources.
*   Save the current canvas as an image to the device's gallery.
*   Real-time ray tracing to simulate light reflection and blocking.

## How to Use

1.  **Add Objects**: Use the buttons at the bottom of the screen to add a new light source (a sun icon), a mirror (a triangle icon), or a flag (a flag icon) to the canvas.
2.  **Select an Object**: Tap on any object on the canvas to select it. A white circle will appear around the selected object.
3.  **Move an Object**: Once an object is selected, you can drag it around the canvas by tapping and holding inside the white selection circle.
4.  **Rotate an Object**: To rotate a selected object, tap and drag the small white handle on the edge of the selection circle.
5.  **Use the Controls**: The buttons at the bottom of the screen provide all the main controls for the application.

## Controls

*   **Add Light**: The yellow sun icon adds a new light source to the canvas.
*   **Add Mirror**: The cyan triangle icon adds a new mirror to the canvas.
*   **Add Flag**: The pink flag icon adds a new flag to the canvas.
*   **Delete**: The red trash can icon (visible only when an object is selected) deletes the currently selected object.
*   **Change Color**: The color wheel icon (visible only when a light source is selected) opens a color picker to change the color of the selected light.
*   **Save**: The green save icon saves the current state of the canvas as a PNG image to your device's gallery.
